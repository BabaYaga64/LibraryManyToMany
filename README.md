#LibraryManyToMany

###Description

This app is based on a library and user stories for both librarians and patrons. Patrons can check out books and librarians can update books in the catalog. There are other functionalities in this app as well. We created five tables and two join statements to connect four of the tables. The fifth table had a one to many relationship with one of the other tables. This app helped me understand how to create database schemas, use join statements to connect databases, and when to use a private property to connect the tables, like the one to many relationship case.
